        <h1>Statistics and Cybersecurity</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">Written by <strong>Andrea Buratti</strong> on October 12, 2025</p>
        <p>
            In today’s digital world, cybersecurity can no longer rely solely on firewalls, antivirus software, or encryption systems. 
            Cyber threats evolve rapidly and take increasingly sophisticated forms.
            For this reason, statistics have become one of the most powerful tools available to cybersecurity experts.
            Analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying anomalous behavior, and estimating the likelihood of attacks or vulnerabilities — all these tasks rely heavily on statistical methods. 
            In practice, defending digital systems today is also a matter of data analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Detecting Anomalies</h2>
        <p>
            Every IT system generates millions of records in its network logs.
            Statistics help model the “normal” behavior of a system (for example, the average hourly traffic or the usual number of server requests) and automatically flag significant deviations.
        </p>

        <p>
            A model based on probability distributions can identify that if a server receives twice the expected traffic at an unusual hour, there’s a high likelihood that a DDoS attack is underway.
        </p>

        <h2>Detecting Phishing and Fraud</h2>
        <p>
            Statistics applied to natural language processing (NLP) allow the analysis of suspicious messages and the assignment of a probability that they are phishing attempts. 
            This involves studying features such as keyword frequency, message length, and the conditional probability of certain textual patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            Spam filters from companies like Google and Microsoft use Bayesian models to automatically classify billions of emails every day.
        </p>

        <h2>Probability Distributions for Predicting Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            Probability distributions are a powerful tool in predicting the likelihood of cybersecurity events. By fitting past data into known distributions—such as the Poisson or exponential distributions—you can estimate the probability of future events. 

For instance, the Poisson distribution is particularly useful for modeling the frequency of random events over a fixed period, such as the number of attempted breaches in a week. It can also determine the probability of each target being affected, prompting preemptive actions like separating access to sensitive corporate data with zero-trust WiFi only, instead of public networks. 

The exponential distribution, on the other hand, can be used to estimate the time between consecutive attacks, providing insight into whether your defenses might need reinforcement. These probability models give a quantifiable outlook on expected attack frequencies, which can be instrumental in budget allocation and response planning.


        </p>            

        <h2>Monte Carlo Simulations for Risk Forecasting
        </h2>
        <p>Monte Carlo simulations are particularly effective for evaluating cybersecurity scenarios where uncertainty and complexity are high. By simulating thousands or even millions of possible outcomes, this method provides a range of potential future risk profiles, allowing decision-makers to understand the probabilities of different scenarios.</p>
        <p>For instance, a Monte Carlo simulation can be used to estimate the potential financial impact of data breaches over the next year. Input variables might include attack frequency, the probability of a successful breach, and the average cost of a breach. 

The simulation will produce a distribution of possible outcomes, which can help organizations prepare for worst-case scenarios while still focusing on the most probable risks.</p>

        <h2>Markov Chains for Attack Path Analysis
        </h2>
        <p>Markov chains are used to model systems that transition between various states, making them ideal for representing attack paths. In cybersecurity, an attack path consists of a sequence of steps that an attacker might take to achieve their objectives, such as moving from initial access to lateral movement within a network.

By assigning probabilities to each state transition, Markov chains can help estimate the likelihood of an attacker reaching a particular objective based on the system’s current state. This can be useful for identifying critical control points where intervention can significantly reduce overall risk.</p>
        <h2>Breaking Simple Cryptography Schemes</h2>
        <p>
            Modern cryptography is based on solid mathematical principles, but simpler schemes (like the Caesar cipher or the Vigenère cipher) can be broken using statistical techniques.
            By analyzing the frequency of letters in an encrypted text, it is possible to infer the encryption key and decrypt the message.
