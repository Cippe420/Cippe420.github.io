        <h1>Statistics and Cybersecurity</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">Written by <strong>Andrea Buratti</strong> on October 12, 2025</p>
        <p>
            In today’s digital world, cybersecurity can no longer rely solely on firewalls, antivirus software, or encryption systems. 
            Cyber threats evolve rapidly and take increasingly sophisticated forms.
            For this reason, statistics have become one of the most powerful tools available to cybersecurity experts.
            Analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying anomalous behavior, and estimating the likelihood of attacks or vulnerabilities — all these tasks rely heavily on statistical methods. 
            In practice, defending digital systems today is also a matter of data analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Detecting Anomalies</h2>
        <p>
            Every IT system generates millions of records in its network logs.
            Statistics help model the “normal” behavior of a system (for example, the average hourly traffic or the usual number of server requests) and automatically flag significant deviations.
        </p>

        <p>
            A model based on probability distributions can identify that if a server receives twice the expected traffic at an unusual hour, there’s a high likelihood that a DDoS attack is underway.
        </p>

        <h2>Detecting Phishing and Fraud</h2>
        <p>
            Statistics applied to natural language processing (NLP) allow the analysis of suspicious messages and the assignment of a probability that they are phishing attempts. 
            This involves studying features such as keyword frequency, message length, and the conditional probability of certain textual patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            Spam filters from companies like Google and Microsoft use Bayesian models to automatically classify billions of emails every day.
        </p>

        <h2>Breaking Simple Cryptography Schemes</h2>
        <p>
            Modern cryptography is based on solid mathematical principles, but simpler schemes (like the Caesar cipher or the Vigenère cipher) can be broken using statistical techniques.
            By analyzing the frequency of letters in an encrypted text, it is possible to infer the encryption key and decrypt the message.
